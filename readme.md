# Nondeterministic Turing machine simulator

This is a nondeterministic Turing machine simulator.

A nondeterministic Turing machine differs from a standard Turing machine by supporting multiple possible transitions.

Build with the Makefile by executing `make`.

Execute with `nondeterministic_tm [-v] <program file>`.

The `-v` flag is for verbose output.

Examples of nondeterministic programs are available in the examples folder.
